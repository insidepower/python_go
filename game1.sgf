Demi [4k\]: you have to copy font.properties.ja over font.properties

Kikuchyo [?\]: How do you write japanese in cgoban?
Demi [4k\]: depends on the OS
km1007 [6k\]: unn?  qamal?
Demi [4k\]: with winxp you have to install east asian language support
Dita [6k\]: Rauli
Dita [6k\]: why does black go s 13 ?
Demi [4k\]: and the japanese keymap
Dita [6k\]: t13 better ?
Rauli [-\]: it's just one attempt

Qamal [10k\]: bubt i cant read it
Dita [6k\]: show me later plz
Qamal [10k\]: so if i wanna read i have to pastge to notepad ^^
Demi [4k\]: just copy font.properties.ja over font.properties and restart cgoban2
Demi [4k\]: then you should be able to read jap too
Rauli [-\]: t12, s12, t13, s11, t14, s11

ariel [2d\]: it is possible to clone this game now to show earlier variations...
